# Strassen_Matrix_Algorithm
CS141 Data Structures and Algorithms. Final project pertaining Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm, all code is included in the main.py file. 

To run the code: Execute on any python supporting IDE that contains basic makefiles and libraries(i.e. numpy). For a test case, run the code, then input the dimension of first matrix, and the corresponding values for it. Do the same for the second matrix. If both matrices entered were valid inputs then, the product matrix will output through the Strassen algorithm. If the system exits due to an invalid input (it will state why the error occured), you can re-run to try a new valid input.
